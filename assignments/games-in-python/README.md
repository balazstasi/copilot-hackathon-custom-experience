## 📝 Tasks

### 🛠️	Create the Hangman Game

#### Description
Develop a text-based Hangman game where players guess letters to reveal a hidden word before running out of attempts. The game should randomly select words and provide feedback on each guess.

#### Requirements
Completed program should:

- Randomly select a word from a predefined list of at least 5 words
- Display the word as underscores (e.g., `_ _ _ _ _`) with correctly guessed letters revealed
- Accept single letter guesses from the player
- Track and display the number of incorrect guesses remaining (start with 6 attempts)
- Show all previously guessed letters to avoid duplicates
- End the game when the word is fully guessed (win) or attempts are exhausted (lose)
- Display appropriate win/lose messages with the correct word revealed
